intro: 
 * what is angular
 * brief comparison of ng vs other frameworks
 * key concepts: directive, controller, service (which will be explained later)
 * overview of project and API endpoints we will be using
stage 1: basic design, html/css
stage 2: add ng and directives/controllers
 * why add script tag at bottom of page?
 * what is a directive? what is a controller? why use a directive here and not just a controller?
 * explain the snakecase to camelcase thing
stage 3: add services -- do this with a small playlist so as to not use up quota
 * what is a service? factory?
 * what is a promise? (and ng's $q.defer version)
 * using $http.get
 * start with the get request commented out, then comment it in with breakpoints so they can see the results
stage 4: add youtubs
 * explain the simple algo (create playlist, search youtube, grab video, and add to playlist)
 * show service (create playlist.then foreach song, search youtube for artist+song, limit 1 video sort by vid count.then add to playlist) -- nested promises, kinda icky 
wrapup:
 * enhancements: ui-router, resolves, etc
 * testing
 * ng1.x ("angularjs") vs ng2+ ("angular") overview
